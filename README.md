I shifted gears to implementing an RSA algorithm because I thought it looked fun!

For the program, I am following the steps outlined on this website: https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/cryptography-tutorial/rsa-algorithm. 

The website does not have code on it, it only outlines the steps of the RSA algorithm.
