# ATCSIndProj - RSA Algorithm

## About RSA
RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is a public-key cryptosystem, one of the oldest widely used for secure data transmission. In this system, an RSA user creates and publishes a public key based on two large prime numbers, along with an auxiliary value. The two prime numbers are kept secret. The message can be encrypted by anyone via the public key, but can only be decrypted by those who know the private key. RSA is a relatively slow algorithm. Because of this, it is not commonly used to directly encrypt user data. More often, RSA is used to transmit shared keys for symmetric-key cryptography, which are then used for bulk encryption–decryption.

### **2024-5-09**
I started reading about Django, which is a useful python framework. I am thinking aboue learning more about this framework as my independent project, but I am not 100% sure. I will decide by next class.

### **2024-5-10**
I shifted gears to implementing an RSA algorithm because I thought it looked fun!

For the program, I am following the steps outlined on this website: **[RSA Tutorial](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/cryptography-tutorial/rsa-algorithm)**. 

The website does not have code on it, it only outlines the steps of the RSA algorithm, which allows me to code the implementation.

### **2024-5-17**
Finished a couple more functions for the rsa algorithm. Got some tests working, but still errrors with text encryption.

### **2024-5-22**
RSA works with numbers and some words.
